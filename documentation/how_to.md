# Documentation How to

## Directories

The child directories of documentation/ must be tech. 
Each tech directory then must be your name.

Ex. documentation/django/rohman

## Filenames 

File names must be descriptive and contain words that are semantically similar
to the contents of the file. File names for documentation can be very long the
point is to be descriptive, so you don't even have to know if the docs exist to
search for them. 

Bad names: 
notes1.txt
django_stuff.txt

Good names with directory: 
django/rohman/django_db_config.md
timescaleDB/rohman/timescale_db_install.md
next/rohman/project_init.md
deployment/rohman/dockerize_db.md

FILENAMES ACT AS SEARCHABLE METADATA

## File lengths

If you can't create a good name for the file then you must split up your
documentation into multiple sections.

THERE SHOULD BE TONS OF DOC FILES
